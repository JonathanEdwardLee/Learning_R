## First project learning R is creating a database. Here is a simple example of my code to do this. A list of fruits and the rank I gave them with 1 being my favorite
> names <- c("banana", "orange", "apple", "pear","grape")
> rank <- c(4,1,2,5,3)
> fruit_ranks <- data.frame (names,rank)
> head(fruit_ranks)
   names rank
1 banana    4
2 orange    1
3  apple    2
4   pear    5
5  grape    3
>
